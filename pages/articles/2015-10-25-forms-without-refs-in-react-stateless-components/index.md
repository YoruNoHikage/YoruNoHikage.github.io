![Silly forms transforms Cover](forms.png)

Hello there, thereâ€™s this silly thing I do with forms in my components and I want to share it with you. I always see people getting form values with refs, things you canâ€™t use in stateless components. But it doesnâ€™t matter, you can use something Javascript has already in itself : events !

If your component looks like this :

```jsx
const RegisterForm = (props) => (
Â  <form onSubmit={submitHandler}>
    <div>
Â Â Â Â Â  <input id="register-username" name="register-username" placeholder="JohnSmith" />
Â Â Â Â Â  <input id="register-email" name="register-email" className="form-input" type="email" placeholder="john.smith@example.com" />
Â Â Â Â Â  <input id="register-password" name="register-password" type="password" placeholder="p4ssw0rd" />
    </div>
Â Â Â  <Button>Register</Button>
Â  </form>
);
```

When the user submit the form, an event is sent with all you need :

```jsx
function submitHandler(e) {
Â  e.preventDefault();
Â  const {
Â Â Â  ['register-username']: {value: username},
Â Â Â  ['register-email']: {value: email},
Â Â Â  ['register-password']: {value: password},
Â  } = e.target;

  // do what you want with the data (username, email and password)
}
```

To those who didnâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going on : You get the value of the children you want from the submitted form and you rename them into proper name. Of course, if you canâ€™t have a form in your component, youâ€™re forced to use a ref and turn this component into a class.

Thatâ€™s it, I know it feels kinda hacky but it works and I find it pretty elegant. Donâ€™t hesitate to tell me your opinion about this. ðŸ˜Š
